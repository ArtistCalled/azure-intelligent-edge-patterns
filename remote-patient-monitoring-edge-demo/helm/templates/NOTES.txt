Yay! Your application deployed successfully. 

Now you need to check to see if it is running correctly.

The first thing to do is check to see if all containers are running correctly by running 

    $ kubectl get pods 

All pods should be "1/1" or "2/2". If not, something went wrong.

If all pods are running, check that the dashboard is working.

You can get the dashboard IP by running:

    $ kubectl get services clinician-dashboard-service --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}{"\n"}'

Copy and paste that out output to your web browser.
