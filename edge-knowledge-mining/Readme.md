Knowledge Mining on the Edge unlocks latent/trapped insights from your content on your Azure Stack Edge appliance, even when you’re not connected to the internet. You simply copy over unstructured files (images, documents or multimedia), apply a variety of AI capabilities (or skills) to extract valuable information that’s trapped within the files, and store them for searching and analysis.
This solution pattern is a microservices architecture composed of services packaged as docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes.
Check out [this video](<KM Edge demo link>) to see a brief introduction to the application and its capabilities. It’s an evolution of the demo we showed at the [GLS event last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciSkeL7nZ8U)

In the new year, we’ll be following up with a series of videos to walk through the architecture and code patterns in the future.
