# Knowledge Mining on Azure Stack Edge

Knowledge Mining on the edge unlocks latent/trapped insights from your content locally on your Azure Stack Edge appliance, even when you’re not connected to the internet. You simply copy over unstructured files (images, documents or multimedia), apply a variety of AI capabilities (or skills) to extract valuable information that’s trapped within the files, and store them for searching and analysis.
This solution pattern is a microservices architecture composed of Azure and OSS services packaged as docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes.

Check out [this video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/IT-Ops-Talk/Knowledge-Mining-on-Azure-Stack-Edge?WT.mc_id=modinfra-0000-thmaure) on Channel 9 to see a brief introduction to the application and its capabilities. It’s an evolution of the demo that was shown at the [GLS 2019 event.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciSkeL7nZ8U)

This could be used for your line of business, archival or mission-oriented data to quickly uncover insights and increase your situational awareness. 

We’ll be following up with a series of videos to walk through the architecture, DevOps and code in this repository.

Please stay tuned for updates…
