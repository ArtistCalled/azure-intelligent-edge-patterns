## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) before you begin.
* A Machine Learning workspace. See [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace).
* A Azure Stack Edge device ready with compute deployed,  [getting started on AS Edge ](https://databoxupdatepackages.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Microsoft-Azure-Stack-Edge-GPU-IoT-K8-20200615.pdf)
* Create a VM with GPU and Iot Edge installed follow instruction here to create VM with GPU, driver, nvidia docker [learn more](https://github.com/MSKeith/iotedge-vm-deploy),ARM template to deploy a GPU enabled VM with IoT Edge pre-installed (via cloud-init)

# How to run Jupyter Notebooks in your workspace


Learn how to run your Jupyter Notebooks directly in your workspace in Azure Machine Learning studio. While you can launch [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io), you can also edit and run your notebooks without leaving the workspace.

See how you can:

* Create Jupyter Notebooks in your workspace
* Run an experiment from a notebook
* Change the notebook environment
* Find details of the compute instances used to run your notebooks
